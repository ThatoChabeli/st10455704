The purpose of Christoffel's Menu App, a React Native application created using Expo, is to assist private chef Christoffel in effectively managing his menu. The software allows users to check the average price of menu items by course, add new menu items, and filter them by course (e.g., starters or main courses). For improved maintainability, core files such as App.tsx and AppNavigator.tsx as well as specific screens like HomeScreen, AddMenuItemScreen, and FilterScreen have been arranged into the proper directories. React Navigation was used to put up a navigation stack that allowed for smooth screen transitions. React-native-screens, react-native-safe-area-context, and react-native-gesture-handler were added as dependencies to provide functionality. TypeScript and import problems were resolved, resolving duplicate identifier errors and guaranteeing that type declarations and screen props are accurate.The src/components section contains reusable components like MenuItem, and the project employs consistent styling across displays. Make sure the Expo CLI is installed globally before using npx expo start to launch the application after cloning the repository and using npm install to install dependencies. Future enhancements might include user authentication, capability for editing and updating menu items, and persistent data storage via SQLite or AsyncStorage. With its well-organised codebase and seamless navigation, this application offers a useful, user-friendly way to manage menu items.
